## Introduction

Following my exploration of MRHB Network, I'm now turning my attention to Creditcoin Network, a blockchain platform focused on creating a global credit history system. This project particularly interests me as it aims to address financial inclusion challenges through blockchain technology, potentially revolutionizing how credit is assessed and managed worldwide.

## Understanding Creditcoin Network

Creditcoin Network is a blockchain platform designed to create a global credit history system by recording and verifying credit transactions on-chain. The platform aims to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance by providing a transparent and immutable record of credit activities.

### Core Mission
- To create a global credit history system accessible to all
- To enable transparent and verifiable credit transactions
- To facilitate financial inclusion through blockchain technology
- To bridge traditional and decentralized finance
