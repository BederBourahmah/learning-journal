## Task Tracking

Tasks are identified using the format: T[Phase]-[Category]-[Sequence]
- Phase: 1 (Foundation), 2 (Pilot), 3 (Implementation)
- Category: A (Architecture), B (Blockchain), C (Compliance), D (Data), E (Security), F (Testing)
- Sequence: Three-digit number (001-999)

Each task must include:
- Task ID
- Status (Pending, In Progress, Blocked, In Human Review, Complete)
- Priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Dependencies (List of task IDs that must be completed before this task)
- Effort (Points estimate)
- Description

Tasks with the same Phase and Category share a sequence number space (001-999). Tasks may be worked on in any order, but dependencies must be satisfied before a task can be marked Complete.
