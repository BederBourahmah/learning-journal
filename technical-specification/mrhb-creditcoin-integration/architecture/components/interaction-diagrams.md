# Component Interaction Diagrams

## Task: T1-A-001-b
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: T1-A-001-a  
**Effort**: 1 point

## Description
Create and document the interaction patterns between system components in the MRHB & Creditcoin integration, including communication methods, protocols, and synchronization patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
To mark this task as Complete, the following must be satisfied:

1. Direct Communication Documentation
   - [ ] API call patterns documented
   - [ ] Request/response formats specified
   - [ ] Error handling flows defined
   - [ ] State verification procedures documented

2. Event-Driven Interactions Documentation
   - [ ] Event types and schemas defined
   - [ ] Event processing flows documented
   - [ ] Event persistence requirements specified
   - [ ] Event monitoring procedures defined

3. Message Passing Documentation
   - [ ] Message formats documented
   - [ ] Routing rules specified
   - [ ] Delivery guarantees defined
   - [ ] Error handling procedures documented

4. State Synchronization Documentation
   - [ ] State change detection procedures defined
   - [ ] State propagation patterns documented
   - [ ] Conflict resolution procedures specified
   - [ ] Consistency check procedures defined

5. Diagram Creation
   - [ ] Component interaction diagrams created
   - [ ] Sequence diagrams for all flows
   - [ ] State transition diagrams documented
   - [ ] Error flow diagrams created

6. Documentation Review
   - [ ] All diagrams peer reviewed
   - [ ] Technical accuracy verified
   - [ ] Consistency with requirements confirmed
   - [ ] Documentation approved by stakeholders

## Current Progress
- Direct Communication: 40% complete
- Event-Driven Interactions: 30% complete
